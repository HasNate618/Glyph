# Example keymaps to test token support (keyTokens and <Token> syntax)

bindings:
  # Unambiguous single-token mapping using keyTokens
  - keyTokens: ["Win"]
    label: Win (single token)
    action: openGlyphGui

  # Inline token usage inside a key string: P then Win then G
  - key: "p<Win>g"
    label: P + Win + g
    action: logForeground

  # Explicit single-token for function key
  - keyTokens: ["F5"]
    label: F5 (single token)
    send: F5

  # Legacy multi-letter sequence: treated as three chars 'w','i','n'
  - key: win
    label: w-i-n sequence (legacy per-char)
    action: openGlyphGui

  # Convenience bare "Win" key (loader maps bare Win to token)
  - key: Win
    label: bare Win convenience (single token)
    action: openLogs

  # Mixed example using angle-bracket tokens and literal chars
  - key: "<Win>g"
    label: Win then g
    action: openGlyphGui

apps:
  - process: Code
    bindings:
      # Per-app single-token mapping
      - keyTokens: ["Win"]
        label: App: Win token
        send: Win+S

# Notes:
# - Use the repository default keymap loader to copy this into %APPDATA% or load it manually for testing.
# - Try both the bare "Win" key and the explicit keyTokens/<Token> forms to compare behavior.
